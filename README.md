Design Decisions

I think Sally’s target demographic would likely be millennial listeners, so I made a color that looks similar to “millennial pink” to use as the background. I also included a lot of gifs and links to music because I think Sally’s viewers would typically enjoy sites like Tumblr that use a lot of moving images.  I edited some famous pictures of Ally Maine and Lady Gaga that fans would recognize and find humorous. 


For the “sad” layout, I made a color that looked like “millennial blue” for the background. I also centered all the images so your eye is drawn directly down and you view the title and images in the given order. I thought that using this layout on the Jackson page would look most similar to a memorial program. The images are sad and one is black and white to fit this theme. I played with font, color and boldness to give the user a different feeling on each page, but overall the layout and coloring is similar so the site feels cohesive. As well as the images and links, I added a button to give some more user interaction. 

Challenge

This assignment was very challenging for me because I was not comfortable setting up with Terminal, and I had no prior experience with Jekyll, Ruby, Github Pages, HTML or any website design. I did a lot of Jekyll-specific research through the Jekyll website and a few other sources to understand how to use it. From there I did HTML research to figure out how to format the text and pages. I now feel more comfortable with website design and HTML. It took me a very long time to figure out how to make the site locally, and then I had a lot of errors with linking once I pushed to Github. Now that I know how to make and host a site with Jekyll, I will be able to repeat this process for future sites. In future I would want to make the layouts more complex. 

Bugs

The Fan Club buttons freeze sometimes.

I had a lot of issues with the Pages files not working after they were synced to Github. I was able to get around this by changing the links to the pages. After the push to Github, I was having a lot of issues viewing the site locally. Viewing the posts through the Github repository works, but there were some issues when downloading them locally. 

The favicon worked on most browsers I tested, but some may not. I wanted to make more complex layouts with images fitted around eachother but as this was my first time using HTML at all it was too challenging. 

Credits 

The inspiration for Sally New Hampshire is the character Ally Maine from A Star is Born (2018). Jackson Maine is also a reference to the film. The character is also a play on Lady Gaga.
