You can listen to two of the best songs [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixrje2rXLMA) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ll04Zzw5UM). Isn't she great?

To celebrate the release of Jolanne, Sally got this tattoo

Before Jolanne, Sally's last album was called CRAFTPUSH. It wasn't that good though so true fans pretend it didn't happen.
